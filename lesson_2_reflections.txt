What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git tracker files/folders are created and this is needed to be able to track changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is the only place you can commit from and allows the flexibility of not committing everything in the working directory/repository
