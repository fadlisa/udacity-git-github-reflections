How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It was obvious.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Makes it easy to spot mistakes made at a particular point and change them without affecting other correct changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manual gives flexibility  but risks human forgetfulness.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
The others weren't designed for programming.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows the changes with dates etc.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can always revert and nothing is ever deleted (apart from hard reset)

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Track changes.
